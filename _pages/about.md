I am a incoming Ph.D Student in Biostatistiics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.I obtained my Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics from Beijing Normal University(China). I am graduating in May with a Master's degree in statistics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I was fortunate to be advised by Professor [Ruoqing Zhu](https://sites.google.com/site/teazrq/home) on fields of influence function.
