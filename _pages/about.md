I am an incoming Ph.D. student in Biostatistics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Beijing Normal University, China. In May, I will be graduating with a Master's degree in Statistics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Under the guidance of Professor [Ruoqing Zhu](https://sites.google.com/site/teazrq/home), I have had the privilege to explore and conduct research in Statistical Genetics and Manifold Learning.
