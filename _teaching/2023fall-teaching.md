### [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign], [Department of Statistics]

#### STAT 432: [Basics of Statistical Learning]
- **Semester**: [2023Fall]
- **Role**: [Course Assistant]
- **Responsibilities**:
  - [Responsibility 1, e.g., Grading assignments]
  - [Responsibility 2, e.g., Conducting lab sessions]
  - [Responsibility 3, e.g., Providing student support and office hours]
- **Course Description**: 
  - This course covers a wide range of topics in machine learning, including both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. Key areas of focus include:
    - **Supervised Learning**:
      - Linear models and penalization methods to prevent overfitting.
      - Discriminant analysis, Naive Bayes, logistic regression for classification.
      - K nearest neighbor, classification and regression trees, random forest, kernel regression for decision-making processes.
      - Support vector machines for high-dimensional learning.
    - **Unsupervised Learning**:
      - PCA, K-mean and hierarchical clustering, self-organizing maps, spectral clustering for data structure discovery.
    - **Concepts**:
      - Understanding the bias-variance trade-off and its implications on model accuracy.
      - Techniques for variable selection and model optimization.
      - Methods like cross-validation and bootstrap for model evaluation and enhancement.
    - **Modeling Problems**:
      - Applications in personalized medicine and imaging data analysis.
